# Reflow Oven

---

# Prerelease Version

Reflow oven meant to be used by hardware and electronics. Includes various fixes

- Lack of source code. This repo provides the source code in addition to the binaries.
- Translation of German Code comments. I have kept the original text, and appended the translation side by side. Please do not delete the german comments.
- fix of several while loop and iterative mistakes. Modularization

# Future-Proofing:

- Add support for multiple thermocouplers

- Add buzzer for cooldown period

# Coding Overview

# To Do:

update stm binary and update nextion binary

~~refactor code for easier use~~
